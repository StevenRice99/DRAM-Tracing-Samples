Samples of how you could perform memory tracing.

# trace-valgrind.sh

Trace ``main.py`` using [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org "Valgrind").

# trace-pin.sh

Trace ``main.py`` using [Intel Pin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html "Intel Pin"). Note this requires this to be located exactly in ``~/DRAM-Tracing-Samples`` and [Intel Pin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html "Intel Pin") to be installed exactly in ``~/pin``.

# main.py

Just a simple placeholder script.
